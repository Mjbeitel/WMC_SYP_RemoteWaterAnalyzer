  Water Management Canada deals with the monitor and service of HVAC systems in commercial, multi-residential, and industrial buildings. Currently all monitoring is done by running periodic manual tests. This method leaves room for optimization as labour is expensive and there is a large period between subsequent tests. In an increasingly connected world, there is opportunity to replace the manual testing with autonomous IOT based sensors.  Spurred by the repercussions of the global pandemic, WMC came to Dalhousie University and Group 13 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department seeking the design of a prototype which could replace their manual checks in a cost-effective manor.  The device would be connected to an existing piping system using T-pipe fitting and monitor various water qualities using sensors. The readings specified to the group were pH, electroconductivity, and water flowrate. The device must connect to an external dashboard and upload the data continuously. The following is group 13â€™s proposed solution to WMC.
